gogoGoals is a Design and Innovation Project for crafting beautiful, intelligent user experiences for tracking goals and manage personal productivity. We aim to develop a flexible, fast, and modularized mobile application that can allow users to easily manage and view goals by category, with intelligent recommendation of to-dos. gogoGoals works with Android and iOS, and is free and open source.

#### Add Multiple Todos in one go
